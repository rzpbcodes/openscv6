### Towards Secure Smart Contracts
---

This repository presents the results of our research on improving the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts.

### Datasets Used
- [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) is an expert-curated benchmark dataset comprising 146 Solidity smart contracts, each annotated with a specific vulnerability type. It includes both the vulnerable and corresponding corrected versions, enabling precise evaluation of analysis tools in terms of both true positives and false positives.

- [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) is a large-scale dataset containing 514,506 deduplicated Solidity source files, extracted from over 3.2 million verified contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This dataset was used to assess the prevalence of arithmetic issues in real-world smart contracts using the six newly developed vulnerability detectors.

### Tools Used
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSysDiligence/mythril) — Version `v0.24.8`
- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) — Version `v11.0`
- **Enhanced Slither** — Six new detectors developed in this study for arithmetic issues documented in [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) dataset.

### Reports
  1. Analysis reports generated by Mythril, Slither, and the Enhanced Slither (with six custom detectors) on the [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) dataset.
  2. Labeled instances of arithmetic issues in the [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) dataset, identified using the six newly developed vulnerability detectors.
